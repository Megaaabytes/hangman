# hangman
hangman in c++. 

The computer chooses a random word from a list of 41 and you have to guess it. 

If you guess correctly, the software will format the string with the letters you chose.

If you guess incorrectly, the software will deduct a life. 

You have 9 lives when you start. If you have 0 you lose. If you guess the word before you lose all of your lives, you win.
